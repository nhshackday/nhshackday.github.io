about: "Digital health wearables and smart phones can provide in-depth acceleromtry and gyrometry data. By using this to measure gait, we can help predict the onset of chronic diseases, from Parkinson's disease to diabetic neuropathy or falls. We have a model which at this stage can detect normal vs abnormal gait, with additional data required to improve accuracy and further delineate specific gaits."
