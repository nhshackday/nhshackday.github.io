about: We’ve developed a user-centered app, built for accessibility, ease of use,
  and a seamless experience—eliminating the frustration of fragmented services and
  providing a reliable, all-in-one healthcare solution. Our key feature is an AI chatbot
  to advise you of the best course of action for the symptoms you are experiencing
  (a&e, emergency services, gp appointment, pharmacy). We have also added a smart
  prescription tracker and reminder system, to ensure  prescriptions can be managed
  efficiently and with ease. Appointment bookings, recaps and future appointment can
  also be accessed within the interface.
