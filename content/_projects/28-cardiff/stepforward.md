about: "Overview\n\nStepForward is a digital platform designed to support individuals
  recovering from serious mental health conditions by offering structured volunteering
  opportunities and clinician-backed monitoring. It bridges the gap between clinical
  recovery and social reintegration, addressing the lack of long-term post-recovery
  support in healthcare systems like NHS Wales and England.\n\nProblem Statement\n\nRecovering
  individuals often struggle with reintegration due to:  \nLimited volunteering opportunities
  – Existing programs require high qualifications (e.g., driver’s licenses) or involve
  high-pressure roles.  \nLack of long-term support – Many recovery tools focus on
  short-term interventions but don’t provide continuous assistance.  \nFragmented
  services – Mental health support is scattered across various apps, hotlines, and
  short-term programs, lacking centralised coordination.\n\nSolution\n\nStepForward
  offers a dual-platform approach:  \nA Patient-Facing App – Provides volunteering
  tasks, progress tracking, and direct support features.  \nA Clinician Platform –
  Enables healthcare providers to monitor patient engagement, assign suitable opportunities,
  and intervene when necessary.  \nBy integrating NHS-backed advice, StepForward ensures
  a safe, step-by-step recovery process where volunteering fosters self-esteem, routine,
  and social engagement.\n\nKey Features\n\nVolunteering & Task Board – Patients access
  opportunities ranked by difficulty, ensuring a gradual transition into community
  roles.  \nScoring & Progression System – Patients earn points for participation,
  building confidence through incremental achievements.  \nAttendance Alerts – Clinics
  receive notifications if a patient misses an event, allowing timely follow-ups.
  \ \nHelp-Seeking Hotline – Users can reach their clinic or case manager directly
  in times of distress.  \nMedical Integration – Secure access to medical history,
  upcoming appointments, and prescriptions ensures continuity of care.  \nEasy Cancellation
  System – Stress-free task cancellations trigger instant alerts for clinician intervention.
  \ \n\nSystem Design\n\nThe StepForward ecosystem consists of:  \nUser Side (Patient
  & Volunteer UI) – Provides a job/task board, chatroom, job filtering, and acceptance
  features.  \nBackend (Clinician Portal & Database) – Doctors track patient progress,
  view appointment calendars, and receive automated alerts for patient inactivity.
  \ \nWatchdog System – Monitors potential scams, detects sensitive words, and alerts
  emergency contacts if a patient is inactive for too long.\n\nWhy StepForward is
  Unique\n\nUnlike existing platforms, StepForward offers:  \nNHS Integration – Ensures
  clinicians remain actively involved in post-recovery tracking.  \nPreventative Measures
  – Task difficulty ranking prevents patients from being overwhelmed.  \nConfidence-Building
  Features – Gamified scoring fosters motivation and long-term engagement.  \nProactive
  Support – Immediate alerts for cancellations and non-participation ensure no patient
  is left behind.\n\nTarget Audience\n\nPatients – Individuals recovering from serious
  mental health conditions seeking structured, low-pressure volunteering.  \nClinicians/NHS
  – Healthcare providers needing long-term tracking tools beyond clinical settings.
  \ \nNGOs & Employers – Organisations looking for reliable, pre-screened volunteers
  supported by healthcare professionals.\n\nImpact & Vision\n\nStepForward transforms
  post-recovery care by reducing relapse rates, enhancing social inclusion, and improving
  employability for vulnerable individuals. It empowers patients to take small, steady
  steps toward long-term self-sufficiency and well-being, redefining recovery as an
  ongoing journey rather than a fixed endpoint."
