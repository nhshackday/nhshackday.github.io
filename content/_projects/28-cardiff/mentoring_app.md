about: We deliver mentoring training for all sorts of people. Nancy and Tei have found
  the training the most impactful of our long careers as doctors in the NHS. Our vision
  is to make mentoring from trained mentors available for all doctors in the NHS.
  This benefits individual doctors, is good for different perspectives, helps the
  NHS and is better for patients. The GMC sees this too, advising doctors to use mentoring
  throughout our careers. Our problem is that we don't have good data about how mentoring
  is used or it's impact. So we want an app that will demonstrate impact, put mentors
  and mentees in contact, peer support and facilitate and track mentoring outcomes.
  We are starting small with a pilot and the genius IT input here has helped us take
  a step forward. Thank you.
