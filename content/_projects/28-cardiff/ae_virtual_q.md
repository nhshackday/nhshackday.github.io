about: An NHS app designed to place non-urgent patients into a virtual queue, helping
  to improve both patient experience and hospital efficiency. The app automatically
  adjusts arrival times based on real-time service availability for X-rays, blood
  tests, and specialist assessments â€” allowing patients to wait at home or in a more
  comfortable setting without losing their place in the queue.
