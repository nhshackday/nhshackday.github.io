about: "The original idea was to try and minimise time for patients in the waiting
  area of A & E departments. We decided to research and understand the problems facing
  the A & E departments and the ED patient input, throughput and output. \nWe developed
  a numerical system model of an A & E department to predict how the system behaves
  using different scenarios using patient pathways and using assets/staff differently"
