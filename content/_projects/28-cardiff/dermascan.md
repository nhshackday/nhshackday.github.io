about: "Our appâ€™s purpose was originally just to provide AI powered diagnosis for
  individuals with unrecognised skin conditions. As we developed the app, we also
  wanted to add a way for individuals with long term skin conditions, such as eczema,
  as well as GPs to monitor, upload and track skin conditions. \n \nOver the weekend
  we created a wireframe example of how we would implement this, as well as describing
  what steps would be needed to implement it effectively."
