about: "The problem, a user story:\n“Dewi has recently graduated his computer science
  degree and is starting a new job working as an NHS data scientist. \n\nHe attended
  a meeting where he struggled to understand what on earth people were talking about,
  and Googling for the answers just left him with more questions.  He is feeling a
  little daunted at the prospect of understanding the complex beast that is healthcare.\nWe
  aim to provide an engaging, interactive, structured tool to help Dewi learn, focusing
  on what is important for his new role.”\n\nOur solution:\nOur first step was to
  brainstorm, this lead to us deciding on a few aims:\n- To provide a structure for
  the learning journey, guided by domain experts\n- To allow adaptability in learning
  pathways for different roles or organisations\n- To provide content, either created
  ourselves or signposted to external resources\n- To be accurate, credible, evergreen,
  open and extendable\n- To be engaging, enthusiastic and captivating\n\nNext, we
  crystalised some of our discussions 5 key themes we believe encapsulate what Dewi
  needs to learn, these are:\n1. How healthcare works\n2. Humans in healthcare\n3.
  Clinical healthcare\n4. Money in healthcare\n5. Being part of a healthcare system\n\nWe
  used generative AI with Flask to allow us to generate proof of concept working demo,
  allowing the majority of our team to focus on the web app to meet our aims.\n"
