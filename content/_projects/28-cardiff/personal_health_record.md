about: Do you move between different areas, countries, or switch between NHS and private
  healthcare? Showing a new provider your medical history can be challenging without
  carrying folders of paperwork like clinic letters and hospital discharge forms.
  Our app solves this problem by gathering all your health information in one place.
  It organizes everything into easy-to-understand categories such as your diagnoses
  or hospital stays. You own all your data, which is stored only on your device for
  maximum privacy and security.
