about: We have been developing a needs based application to support people to be able
  to plan safe and tolerable routes to get out and about in their community.  This
  has been based on a needs mapping, data on hazards and supportive features from
  both publicly available and user entered data. It aims to allow for time varying
  route features such as impact of weather (rain, wind) as well as the opportunity
  to specify total route restrictions (such as total elevation).
