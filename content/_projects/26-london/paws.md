about: Out app aims to tackle the stigma that teenagers have in seeking out mental
  well-being support by encouraging them to create a pet they can interact with. The
  app is designed to provide teens with a companion that learns about them and matches
  their tone of voice. It's designed for daily engagement through ai-powered chat,
  a positive social content feed, and the ability to connect with friends and see
  how their pets are doing.
