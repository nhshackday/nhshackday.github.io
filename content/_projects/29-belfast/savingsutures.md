about: 'Problem: millions of pounds worth of expired medical equipment is disposed
  of, costing money for hospitals. Meanwhile student societies have limited budgets
  and can use this equipment to train the next generation of doctors. We have created
  a national database to connect hospitals who have expired equipment with student
  societies who can use it.'
