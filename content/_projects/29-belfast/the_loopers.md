about: Patients identify challenges in relation to understanding their healthcare
  journey between GP authorising blood tests through to accessing the results of these
  tests. Whilst keeping patient experiences and access to healthcare resources at
  the centre of our considerations we used improvement methodology and journey mapping
  primarily from the perspective of patient, and subsequently the actions of healthcare
  professionals. In doing so we were able to identify pain points used to inform where
  digital solutions could be integrated to empower patients to better understand and
  participate in their healthcare journey. From this weekend have created a clinician
  and patient demo.
