about: 'Whole Story is an AI companion designed to help patients clearly express their
  needs and share their full story with healthcare providers. By supporting patients
  in articulating what matters most to them, along with optional input from trusted
  loved ones, it gives practitioners a more complete picture from the very first point
  of contact.

  The tool is built around the ICE framework (Ideas, Concerns, and Expectations) commonly
  used by GPs to structure patient consultations. Through private, guided conversation,
  Whole Story helps individuals explore what they are experiencing, what they think
  might be happening, what worries them, and what outcomes they hope for.

  The process begins when a loved one notices changes and, with consent, books an
  appointment with GP and helps the person connect to Whole Story via phone, tablet,
  or computer. The patient then has time to reflect and speak freely in their own
  words. If consented, the loved one can also contribute their observations, adding
  valuable context. Together, this information is summarised and shared with the GP,
  helping the patient feel more confident and prepared for their appointment.

  For clinicians, Whole Story improves understanding and efficiency. Consultations
  start with a clearer, richer view of the person’s situation, reducing the need for
  repeat appointments and preventing misunderstandings that can lead to complaints.
  Patients feel heard, supported, and better able to participate in decisions about
  their care.

  Looking ahead, Whole Story has the potential to evolve into an app used across health
  and care settings. Acting as a home companion (similar to Siri or Alexa) it could
  engage with individuals over time, identify emerging themes, and share relevant
  insights with GPs, geriatricians, social workers, carers, and mental health professionals.
  This would create a more connected, whole-picture view of each person’s wellbeing,
  fostering collaboration and continuity of care.

  Impact: fewer appointments, fewer complaints, more satisfied patients and professionals.'
