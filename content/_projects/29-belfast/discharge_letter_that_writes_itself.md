about: |
  Creating the discharge letter, the single clinical handover as a patient transitions from hospital to home, is a vitally important job delegated to foundation doctors, but this requires sifting through the medical notes to extract the necessary information on patients for whom they may have had little prior knowledge. As a result, when these letters reach the GP, they often miss information on medication or other important details of the admission, with a risk of adversely affecting the patient’s ongoing care.

  Imagine if the discharge letter was created automatically from the start of the patient’s admission and was available as a live and evolving document to be refined by the whole clinical team on ward rounds, containing a minimum dataset of quality information. The data will be collected via the Electronic health record and fed into a large language model AI which will then provide a discharge paper with the filled in details and some generated comments like for the explanation. Everything will be live updated and will be kept so doctors will have access to a full medical history of each patient as well as each discharge paper.
