about: 'Safe Stride is a proactive, patient-centred system that predicts and supports
  risk of falls before they happen. It combines wearable and ambient sensor data with
  clinical information to identify subtle changes in mobility, sleep, or hydration
  that signal rising risk. The platform analyses both modifiable and non-modifiable
  factors to create a real-time, personalised risk profile, providing timely alerts
  to clinicians and carers so that interventions can occur early and safely.


  Designed for scalability, Safe Stride integrates seamlessly with smart-home technologies
  and existing NHS systems. It has extensive potential to support people living with
  chronic health conditions, frailty, or mobility challenges both in the community
  and in care facilities. By centring design around patients, particularly those often
  excluded from digital innovation, our multidisciplinary team has addressed a vital
  policy priority in frailty and digital health while developing a solution that benefits
  us all.'
