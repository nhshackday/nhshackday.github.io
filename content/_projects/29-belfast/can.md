about: |
  A webapp platform to digitize the Personal Development Plan process that can extract areas for improvement from the written PDP and provide data driven suggestions of resources and colleagues to connect with. 

  The web app will allow GPs to find relevant events to attend, upload and share resources that may be helpful for other GPs, and find fellow GPs to connect with that can share knowledge and upskill each other.

  The web app will automatically track activities that can feed into future PDPs, such as the hours of CPD work logged, the number of resources shared, and the number of events attended.

  This project is novel and timely as the emphasis of the domains within the Continuing Professional Development framework is shifting from clinical upskilling to colleagues, culture, safety, trust, and professionalism. This platform will fulfils the needs of GPs that now, more than ever, need to connect with each other to fulfil these newly emphasized domains and continue to advocate for patient safety.
