about: This project delivers a working prototype of a digital front door for GP practices, designed to improve patient access to primary care using a conversational AI Agent. Built for web, text and voice-based interaction, the system allows patients to describe their needs in natural language and receive clear, safe, and appropriate triage outcomes — without the need for complex forms or long waits.
