  The project has been built by people living with or alongside people living with diabetes.

  It uses information from glucose sensor devices, insulin pumps, connected pens, wrist-worn health trackers, online calendar apps, and user-inputted data to inform decisions, including:

  - insulin dosing
  - carbohydrate intake
  - device expiry dates and times
  - prescription ordering
  - menstrual cycle tracking
  - management of sickness
