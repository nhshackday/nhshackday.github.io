about: elective recovery is limited by inefficiency and inequality in the preassessment
  process.  We are building a data summary solution that supports healthcare professionals
  in reviewing patients on waiting lists. It transforms an inefficient and inconsistent
  process in to a highly reliable, fair and transparent process. Most importantly
  is reduces the cost of preoperative assessment.
