about: 'A website or app that allows doctors to create a learning pathway of various
  modules of education, which contains information about their condition, management
  techniques etc.

  A QR code containing this learning pathway information is then displayed on the
  doctors device

  The patient then scans this QR code using a hospital provided device or their own
  phone, the modules of learning are then added to their account. The account can
  track progress through the pathway and quizzes are included as part of each module
  to check patient understanding. Gaps in knowledge can then be identified which allows
  a doctor to use their time more efficiently and provide targeted explanations.'
