about: Our project transforms hospital waiting experiences by reducing uncertainty
  rather than wait times themselves. Like Uber’s live map, our solution provides patients
  with real-time updates, estimated waiting times, and clear communication. By improving
  transparency and reducing anxiety, we enhance patient satisfaction, trust, and overall
  hospital experience—proving that informed waiting feels shorter and less stressful.
