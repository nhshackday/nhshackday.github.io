about: 'Background:

  The healthcare supply chain involves multiple stakeholders, including suppliers,
  manufacturers, wholesalers, health providers (hospitals, pharmacies, GP practices),
  and patients. There are also governmental departments involved, such as NHS England,
  UKHSA, MHRA, and local authorities.


  Unmet Needs:

  1. Patients face delays in treatment, resulting in delays to treatment, inappropriate
  self-medication and hospitalisations.

  2. Prescribers across primary and secondary care often lack awareness of medicine
  stock and alternatives.

  3. Discord between pharmacy and clinicians due to supply chain issues.

  4. Inappropriate stockpiling and wastage by pharmacies and wholesalers.

  5. Poor communication between governmental bodies and health bodies.

  6. Wholesalers face challenges with steady supply and logistics.

  7. Manufacturers struggle with quality assurance and streamlined communication.


  Proposed Solution: (Supply ChAInge)


  An agile cross-sector user interface that allows communication between pharmacies,
  wholesalers, and manufacturers, enabling health professionals to deliver timely,
  safe & cost-effective care for patients. The platform would include features such
  as:

  1. listing alternatives and modelling impact.

  2. Flagging supply chain issues (Red, Amber, Green system).

  3. Secure communication between stakeholders.

  4. Price transparency (for pharmacies, hospitals  & government bodies only).

  5. Two-way communication.

  6. Historical price tracking (for pharmacies, hospitals  & government bodies only).


  Methods:


  The document doesn''t explicitly outline methods, but it suggests using AI/ML tools
  to map pathways and processes before and after implementation.


  Impact:


  The solution aims to:

  1. Optimise medicine use

  2. Reduce waste and inefficiency

  3. Improve patient outcomes

  4. Enable innovation in the healthcare supply chain


  Timeline:


  No specific timeline is provided in the document.



  Future Plans:

  1. Clinical decision support (2b medical device)

  2. Patient Portal

  3. Patient Ratings'
