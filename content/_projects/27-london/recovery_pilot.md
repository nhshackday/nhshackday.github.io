about:
  "Our app addresses a common issue: many patients discharged from hospitals
  experience preventable complications due to unclear recovery guidance. Our solution
  provides personalized, daily check-ins through an easy-to-use app, asking patients
  about symptoms, recovery progress, and medication adherence. Unlike traditional
  discharge leaflets that are often overlooked, our app keeps patients engaged through
  daily reminders, helping them stay on track with their recovery. If a patient reports
  concerning symptoms, the app guides them on the next steps, such as contacting their
  GP or returning to the hospital. By empowering patients with timely support and
  reducing the likelihood of complications, we aim to lower hospital readmissions,
  improve recovery outcomes, and enhance patient satisfaction within the NHS."
