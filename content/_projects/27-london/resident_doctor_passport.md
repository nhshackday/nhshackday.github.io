about:
  "Doctors enter their data once, into an account identified by their GMC number.
  This information includes personal details, immunisation history, bank and salary
  details, vehicle details, and important documents. \nOrganisations can sign up to
  the platform and search for doctors ahead of their employment, and request access
  to their data, which must be approved an a ‘relationship by relationship’ basis.\nThe
  data is structured in a PostgreSQL database for easy retrieval and querying."
