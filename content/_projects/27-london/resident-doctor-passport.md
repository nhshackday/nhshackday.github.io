about: "Doctors enter their data once, into an account identified by their GMC number. This information includes personal details, immunisation history, bank and salary details, vehicle details, and important documents. 
Organisations can sign up to the platform and search for doctors ahead of their employment, and request access to their data, which must be approved an a ‘relationship by relationship’ basis.
The data is structured in a PostgreSQL database for easy retrieval and querying."
