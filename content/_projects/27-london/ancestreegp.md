about:
  "Who this benefits: patients who want to know more about their family health,
  and GP's who want more accurate family history information.

  Patient will require to give consent to have their disease records linked with
  family members (who would have given consent as well).

  Doctor will be able to view at risk patients (with large number of close
  degree family members with certain diseases) and decide whether to
  investigate.

  Doctor can inform patient (if they have consented to being shared this
  information) about whether they want to know about personal risk of disease.

  Patient can also ask doctor about their risk of hereditary diseases and GP can
  confirm."
