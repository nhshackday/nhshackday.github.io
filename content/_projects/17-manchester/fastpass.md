hackday: "17-manchester"
title: "FastPass"
summary: "Currently, 20% of calls to our IT service desk are for password resets. On top of this, 13% of calls are not answered due to staffing and resources. Our goal is to reduce the amount of password reset calls to just 10% to allow our service desk to support all of our staff. We have designed FastPass with this in mind.

FastPass is a Web based app that allows users to easily change their password when they forget it. With up to 17million people in the UK forgetting their password on a regular basis, FastPass is ideal for getting clinical and non clinical staff up and working again in a matter of seconds."
