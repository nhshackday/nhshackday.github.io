title: "Surgical Operation Notes: Ruby to Opal"
summary: "Surgical operation notes form a key part of a patient's digital peri-operative care record. We had a legacy web app written in Ruby v1.x that had 15K+ records but did not meet IG requirements and was due to be deleted. Our team managed to get it running, exported the db schema and re-built it using Opal."
