We are back! After an unplanned hiatus the wheels are turning and we should have something to announce soon about the next NHS Hack Day. However‚Ä¶

In the last ~8 months our mailing list provider Mailchimp deleted our account without notice or warning what follows is the 2022 edition of a series of posts from [2018](https://blog.rongarret.info/2018/12/mailchimp-deleted-my-account-with-no.html), [2019](http://danielpuglisi.com/articles/2019/05/mailchimp-deleted-my-account-with-no-warning-or-notification-2019-edition) and [2020](https://www.nrmitchi.com/2020/12/mailchimp-deleted-my-account-with-no-warning-or-notification-2020-edition/) that have catalogued Mailchimp deleting accounts because they aren‚Äôt sending enough emails.

Writing public posts seems to be the [only thing](https://blog.rongarret.info/2018/12/mailchimp-deleted-my-account-with-no.html) that has ever managed to make Mailchimp restore accounts that have been ‚Äúpermanently‚Äù deleted ü§ûüèº. Hope is not a full plan so we have a new mailing list:

{:class="centre"}
<a href="https://dashboard.mailerlite.com/forms/124997/63445041948918915/share" class="btn btn-success">Join Mailing List</a>

You should register on our mailing list if you are interested in the occasional (~3-4 per/year) news and announcement message about upcoming events and ticket releases.
