<p>Submissions should offer concrete contributions, by example, to the question: How can we build an environment where world class NHS digital services flourish?</p>

<p>Although, any submission does not need to be digital (e.g. a card game would be fine).</p>

<h2>Red lines - necessities for a prize</h2>

<p>Something usable must exist</p>

<p>It must be possible for someone to get some benefit out of the submission tomorrow.
<br />
e.g. A usable but buggy system is fine, a set of photoshop layouts of a system is not.
</p>

<p>It was done over the weekend
<br />
If people are adding functionality to an existing service, it is only the additional functionality from the weekend that can be considered.
</p>
<p>
Submissions offering a (semi-)commercial app that they've worked on for 6 months is an immediate, automatic, non-appealable, disqualification from consideration.
</p>

<h2>Other criteria</h2>
<P>
These are open, flexible, and non-exhaustive.
</p>
<p>
Most help to the most in need
</p>
<p>
What is the real world benefit to those who need the most support? Does this submission offer a disproportionate outcome to effort?<br />
e.g. A very flashy iPhone app for booking your Private Hospital dinner should rate much lower than a text message notification reminding people without smartphones of their critical appointments/medication.
</p>
<p>
Do you like it?
<br />
That's important.
</p>
<p>
Humour also works. Is it actually funny?
</p>
<p>
Will it actually work?
<br />
Either in practice, or, if you're not sure, at least generate a conversation that is worth having.
</p>
<h2>Hard Problems</h2>
<p>
A less comprehensive attempt on a very hard problem is at least as good as a flashy attempt on an easy problem.
</p>
<p>
Something incredible by one person is better than something mediocre by a team
</p>
<p>
Who built something is irrelevant; what is built matters; why it was built can be taken into account (and this may feed into other areas much more strongly).
</p>
<h2>
Minimally invasive procedures</h2>
<p>
Submissions that do a more practical job of a key critical aspect, with immediate benefit, even if nothing else at all changes, should be preferred over submissions that require large scale, immediate, fundamental process change.
</p>
<h2>
Policy bombs
</h2>
<p>
Submissions that severely damage a Government Policy, or a well-funded project, simply by existing, should get at minimum an honourable mention (and their presentation sent to the appropriate bit of Government).
