NHS Hack Day celebrates practical, user-centred improvements to health and care.

Submissions should offer concrete contributions, by example, to the question: How can we build an environment where world class NHS digital services flourish?

Although, submissions do not need to be digital (e.g. a 'card game' would be fine if it meets the rest of the brief!).

## Red Lines
These are red lines governing whether a project is eligible for a prize:

- **Something usable must exist.** A demo, tool, dataset, service sketch, policy draft or prototype — so long as someone could get value from it tomorrow. Slides alone aren’t enough.

- **Built this weekend.** If you extend an existing project, only the weekend’s contribution is judged. If you present a contribution not build during the weekend, it is not eligible for a prize. (This ensures we celebrate genuine weekend creativity, not polished marketing pitches.)

- **No pre-built commercial apps.** Commerical or semi-commercial products developed over many months are not eligible for prizes. Projects that are built to enhance an existing commercial or semi-commercial product are not eligible for prizes.


## Core Evaluation Criteria
**1. Problem & insight – Is this a real, clearly articulated problem grounded in lived experience and/or frontline practice?**
   
   _What we’re looking for:_
   - a clear problem statement
   - evidence that it is a real problem that has come from patients, carers or staff
   - explanation of why any existing solutions fall short

**2.⁠ ⁠Impact & inclusion – Who benefits and by how much — and does the idea consider patients/carers, accessibility, equity and safety?**

_What we’re looking for:_
  - articulation of the likely scale of benefit, and where will the benefit be felt
  - consideration of underserved and seldomly heard groups
  - acknowledgment of safety risks and approaches to mitigation

**3.⁠ ⁠Approach & learning – Are the methods sensible, with user input, evidence-informed choices, and ethical use of data/AI?**

_What we’re looking for:_
- evidence of user research, quick tests, references to prior art
- consideration of ethical / data safeguards
- communication of what was learned over the weekend

**4. Prototype & feasibility - Does something actually work and/or is there a credible path to next steps in the real world?**

_What we’re looking for:_
- a working demo, protoype, artefact (not just slides)
- a realistic plan for pilots, finding partners, regulation or operations

**5.⁠ ⁠Teamwork & clarity – Is the story clear, honest about limits, open to feedback, and was there good multidisciplinary collaboration?**

_What we’re looking for:_
- a concise narrative about the problem
- reflection on what’s hard about tackling the problem
- evidence of multi-disciplinary contribution
- balanced voices during the presentation, and credit appropriately distributed

## Bonus Points

**1. Hard Problems** – tackling something genuinely tough counts. A brave attempt on a difficult issue can be as impressive as a slick fix for an easy one.

**2. Minimal effort or a short path to real-world value** – small, practical changes that create immediate benefit score highly.

**3. Policy Bombs** – if your prototype usefully challenges an ineffective or over-funded policy, it deserves at least an honourable mention.

**4. Humour & joy** – if it makes people smile while helping someone in need, all the better.
