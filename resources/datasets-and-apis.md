## Wish list
Things we'd love to have!

- [HES data](http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes) - as a minimum, aggregates could be made available at useful levels
- [NICOR](http://www.ucl.ac.uk/nicor/nicor/nicorandtheclinicaldatatransparencyinitiative) - positive intent, but difficult to find data
- [Legacy Library](http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/action/search/basic) - to be scraped and mined
- <http://www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2010FAI15.html> - [to be scraped and mined](http://wiki.nhshackday.com/wiki/DatasetsAndAPIs?action=AttachFile&amp;do=view&amp;target=FAIs.zip)
- Data at hospital level rather than trust level - important for a public audience who don't know or care about who runs an organisation and important for understanding variations within a provider
- CQC's Quality and Risk Profiles (currently only available to providers and CQC staff)
