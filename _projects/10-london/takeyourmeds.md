about: "The Take Your Meds project was born at NHS Hack Day 10 in London in 2015, and has since continued to be developed by a small team.\n
\n
Take Your Meds Ltd was set up in July 2015 by Helen Jackson ([@DeckOfPandas](https://twitter.com/DeckOfPandas)) and Marcus Baw ([@marcus_baw](https://twitter.com/marcus_baw)).\n
\n
It has a small number of users, and there are plans to collect feedback and conduct an audit before testing the service in GP practices and dental surgeries."
