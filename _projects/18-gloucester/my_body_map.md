title: "My Body Map"
summary: "My body map tries to make life easier for transgender people and anyone who has had organs removed to inform their GP and screening services of what organs remain in their body. It helps patient in their ability to assert that data on their bodies is accurate and avoids stigmatising people who may feel bothered by the current screening processes sending emails about tests they may not need."
