summary: "Emergency departments are under significant constraints which impacts service provision, most visibly demonstrated by A&E waiting times. We have developed a model to simulate patient flow through an emergency department to highlight impacts of staffing levels on patient wellbeing and experience. This is of value to clinical leads, and financial officers in terms of resource costs and operations to plan staffing levels and service delivery to maximise utilisation, and avoid bottlenecks. And ultimately this will be of greatest value to patients and their loved ones."
