summary: "There are currently 850,000 people with dementia in the UK. Care for patients with dementia costs a total of over 26 billion per year. Dementia represents a significant loss of quality of life for those suffering from the disease but also for their loved ones. A key to reducing the negative impact of this progressive disease is through early detection. This would allow medication to be given in order to slow down disease progression, ensure adequate, timely care for those who need it and support for their loved ones."
