title: "Margo/TeachMeMed"
summary: "TeachMeMed is an Alexa based, spaced-repetition question bank to help medical students prepare for their exams. Using Alexa caters to other learning styles (auditory and verbal) that traditional multiple choice question banks do not - and provides interactivity (as well as freeing up both your hands - imagine what you can do!). Margo is a cross-platform plugin intended to support reflective practice among medical students. It does this by providing relevant prompts in response to reflective accounts written by the student."
