hackday: "17-manchester"
title: "Health and Social Care Science-fiction story"
summary: "The short-story is being written in response to Writing the Future, the leading science fiction prize for health and health care.

Using a series of vignettes, our story focuses on the development and evolution of Life AI, as a highly disruptive personal health technology over the next 80 years to 2100, exploring its social impact, both intended and unintended.

Having begun the 10,000 word story at NHS Hackday we will complete it by the 8 August deadline and donate half of our Â£10,000 prize to support future NHS Hackday events."
