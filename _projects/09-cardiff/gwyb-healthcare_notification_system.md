summary: 'GWYB is a multilingual notification system, configured by patient or their
  nominated representative, that allows for complex multichannel information exchange
  in response to triggering events like attending a health or care facility, such
  as Accident & Emergency or calling an ambulance.

  Built on the existing, open source technology of OpenEHR, and developed from the
  beginning with input from patients, GWYB aims to deliver important, personalised
  clinical information to care givers when it is most needed.

  Team GWYB believe that this system could deliver, from day one, significant improvements
  in care for vulnerable patient groups.
