summary: Medical students in hospital can often find themselves without any formal
  teaching arranged. Although informal teaching may be taking place throughout the
  hospital, students are often unaware of where this is happening. Medboard connects
  healthcare professionals who want to teach and students who want to learn. Sessions
  are added by healthcare professionals about an event that is happening in the near
  future. This is added to a real-time database of learning opportunities which students
  can access. Students who are keen to attend then have the option of signing up to
  attend a particular session.
