summary: How to capture intuitive clinical decisions in real time in a way that doesn't
  interfere with the (sophisticated but delicate) cognitive process. The decisions
  are influenced by 5 underlying factors, or signifiers, that all clinicians use instinctively.
  The 5 signifiers sit on simple scale of 1 simple to 5 chaotic. The scores are added
  to create a total from 5 to 25, but more importantly the numbers create a pattern
  that matches the original intuition. This can be captured over time to show change,
  monitor safety, trigger communications, measure demand and demonstrate individual
  and collective patient outcomes.
