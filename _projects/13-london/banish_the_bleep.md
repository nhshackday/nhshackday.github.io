title: "Banish the bleep"
summary: "Bleeps are a disruptive, stressful, inefficient means of communication. We created a prototype portal that allows staff to notify teams about non-urgent tasks. Doctors can recieve and respond to these notifications on their smartphones. This improves communication and prevents unecessary doctorus interruptus."
