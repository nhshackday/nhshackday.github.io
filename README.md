# nhshackday.github.io

Welcome to the _new_, new NHS Hack Day website. This is a rebuild of the older
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) site that was last refreshed in ?January 2016.
There is little that has changed from a design perspective (there has been a
metaphorical "lick of paint" for more consistent styling, better responsive /
mobile design and some changes to how projects are displayed) but the underlying
structure, templates and CSS have undergone a complete rebuild.

This `README` is broken into a few sections for ease of use:
- [Day-to-day Tasks](#day-to-day-tasks) (e.g adding events, sponsors, projects, blog posts)
- [Detailed Documentation](#detailed-documentation) of templates and options
- [Technical Details](#technical-details) (how to contribute, set-up locally, create pull requests and how some of CI magic is wired up)

---

## Day-to-day Tasks
- [Adding an Event](#adding-an-event)
- [Adding a Sponsor to an Event](#adding-a-sponsor-to-an-event)
- [Adding a Project to an Event](#adding-a-project-to-an-event)
- [Adding a Blog Post](#adding-a-blog-post)
- [Adding a `short-link`](#adding-a-short-link)
- [Basic Kramdown and Internal Links](#basic-kramdown-and-internal-links)

### Adding an Event

Events are stored in the `content/_events` directory with a file naming
convention as follows: `YYYY-MM-DD-city.md` The site responds dynamically
(when it is built) to the dates used automatically listing an event as
upcoming or past, for upcoming events without a set date see below on how
to use `date_end`. To hide an event from the upcoming section on the homepage
set `hide_upcoming` to `true`.

New event files should contain at a minimum the following YAML
[Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) with appropriate substitutions:

```yaml
---
venue: Venue Location       # Venue location displayed as: <Venue>, <City>
city: City                  # City of Hack Day
organiser:                  # List of organisers
  - An Organiser
date: 2018-01-27            # Start date of Event should be same a file prefix formated as `YYYY-MM-DD`
date_end: 2018-01-28        # End date of Event formated as `YYYY-MM-DD` OR describing timeframe e.g `Spring 2018`
hackday: 00-location        # Unique slug for event in form of hackday-location

redirect_from:              # List of alternative urls always caontains `/projects/<hackday>`
  - /projects/00-location/

tickets: http://tickets.com/event       # Link to event managment site, used for `Sign Up` link
pitches: http://forms.com/form          # Destination for the `short-link` at `/pitch`
presentations: http://forms.com/form    # Destination for the `short-link` at `/present`

hide_upcoming: true        # If set hides event from the upcoming list on homepage
---
```

Keys should be fairly self explanatory, see previous events for worked examples or
the [detailed documentation]() below for other options and values that can be set.

### Adding a Sponsor to an Event

Sponsor are in separate files in the `content/_sponsors` directory, if the sponsor
has previously supported an event locate the appropriate file (e.g.
`content/_sponsors/open_health_care_uk.md`) and edit to add the event and sponsorship
value, otherwise create a new file named appropriately containing the following YAML
[Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) with appropriate substitutions:

```yaml
---
title: A Sponsor             # Sponsor Name
link: http://website.com     # Sponsor URL
logo: asponsor_logo.png      # Sponsor Logo stored in `/assets/images/sponsors/<logo>`

# Events sponsored denoted by `<hackday>` and sponsorship amount/resource
events:
  01-london: "Â£100, Venue"
---
```

See the `content/_sponsors/_template.md` or existing sponsors for worked examples or
the [detailed documentation]() below.

### Adding a Project to an Event
Projects are in individual files in the `content/_projects` directory in the
subdirectory for the specific event (named using the `<hackday>` slug) e.g.
`content/_projects/01-london/mobile_formulary.md`

Create the appropriate subdirectory if it doesn't exist, and then create a
separate file for each project with the following YAML
[Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/) with appropriate substitutions:

**NB. There are various scripts and scrappers that can be used to automatically 
generate these file from spreadsheets or the older formats used in previous 
versions of the NHS Hack Day website**

```yaml
---
hackday: 00-location            # <hackday> slug for event project was presented at
title: Project Name             # Project Name
summary: Short Summary          # Short summary ideally ~50 words
thumbnail:                      # Thumbnail image stored in `/assets/images/projects/<hackday>/<thumbnail>`
header_image:                   # Header image stored in `/assets/images/projects/<hackday>/<header_image>`
image_credit: []                # Image credit remove [] if using and uncomment following lines
#- Credit:
#   URL:
#   Licence:
team:                           # List of (preferably) twitter handles but can include plain-text names
  - "@nhshackday"
email:                          # Email to list on project page for contact
links:
  presentation:                 # Link to presentation used on day 2
  website:                      # Link to live project demo/app/appstore link/etc.
  code:                         # List of links to project source code e.g GitHub
    - https://github.com/
licence:                        # Licence code/project is released under e.g MIT, GPL etc.
about: "Longer description"     # Longer description 150-200 words can contain Kramdown/Markdown
featured: false                 # If project is featured
---
```

See the `content/_projects/_template.md` or existing projects for worked examples
or the [detailed documentation]() below.

### Adding a Blog Post
Blog Posts are stored in the `content/_blog` directory with a file naming convention
as follows: `YYYY-MM-DD-post-title.md` The first 50 words of each post are displayed
on the the index page along-side the `title` and `subtitle` set in the YAML
[Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/), at a minimum each file should
contain the following:

```yaml
---
title: Title of the Post        # Title of Blog Post
subtitle: Subtitle (optional)   # SubTitle of Blog Post (optinal)
date: 2017-11-15                # Date of Post in format: `YYYY-MM-DD`
authors:                        # List of authors and link (usualy to Tiwtter)
  - name: Author Name
    url : https://twitter.com/handle
header_image: post-2-banner.jpg # Header image stored in `/assets/images/headers/<header_image>`
image_credit: []                # Image credit remove [] if using and uncomment following lines
#- Credit:
#   URL:
#   Licence:
---
```

See existing posts for worked examples or the [detailed documentation]() below.

### Adding a `short-link`
There are some "magic" short links that use information from upcoming events to
dynamically change their destination these are: `/pitch` and `/present` which are
set using the Front Matter in each event see [above](#adding-an-event).

There are also some "static" short links to useful things, these links are stored
in `links` directory as separate files containing the following YAML
[Front Matter](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/frontmatter/):

```yaml
---
layout: link                # Must be set as `link`
permalink: /short           # The short link n.b. be careful not to use the name of an existing page
redirect_to: "http://redirect-to-here.com/" # The location to redirect to
---
```

### Basic Kramdown and Internal Links
The majority of page on the site are written in
[Kramdown](https://kramdown.gettalong.org/) (templates a specific pages are written in HTML).
Kramdown is a superset of Markdown which is a lightweight markup language with plain text
formatting syntax. For a basic guide see the 
[GitHub Guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

In-order to aid maintainability and prevent broken links is is important to use the following
Jekyll syntax when linking internally e.g to a blog post:

{% raw %}
```md
[Top 10 tips for awesome pitches]({% link _blog/2017-11-15-10-tips-for-awesome-pitches.md %})
```

Note that rather than using the URL of the page instead the following is used
`{% link path/to/file.md %}` to link to the file.

{% endraw %}

- [Testing on `newNHSHackdaySite.github.io`](#testing-on-newnhshackdaysitegithubio)

### How to contribute changes

The preferred method of contributing is to submit a
[Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/), the
easiest way to do this is to [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the
`nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io` repository make changes to your repository and then
submit a Pull Request.

1. [Fork](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/) the `nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io.git`
2. Clone and [set-up](#how-to-set-up-and-run-locally) the repository (see below)
3. Make changes (see rest of this `README`)
4. `git commit` your changes to a new [branch](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-and-deleting-branches-within-your-repository/) (e.g `git branch new-stuff`)
5. `git push` your changes back to GitHub
6. Create a [Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

_Remember if you previously cloned the `nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io` repository you
should [sync](https://help.github.com/articles/syncing-a-fork/) (e.g `git fetch upstream`)
your fork before making changes to avoid conflicts and ensure you are working on the most
up-to-date version._

### How to set-up and run locally

Ensure you have a reasonably up-to-date (>2.1.0) version of [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/)
installed using your preferred package manager for your chosen operating system. For more info
on using Jekyll (GitHub Pages variety) locally see:
<https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/>

```bash
# Substitute with the address of your fork if needed
git clone https://github.com/nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io.git
cd nhshackday.github.io.git

# To set-up after initial clone
gem install bundler
bundle install

# To enable `jekyll-compress-images` plugin set:
# export DISABLE_WHITELIST=true

# To lanuch local development server
bundle exec jekyll serve
```

### How to use Docker and/or Docker Compose to run locally

If you want to avoid installing Ruby and managing dependencies with `bundle` you
can instead use Docker to build an image from the `Dockerfile` in this
repository to run GitHub Pages Jekyll locally.

Ensure you have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/overview/) (and
optionally [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/overview/))
installed then:

```bash
# Substitute with the address of your fork if needed
git clone https://github.com/nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io.git
cd nhshackday.github.io.git

# Run Docker Compose
docker-compose up
```

Or you can manually build and run the docker image if you want more control:

```bash
# Clone and/or change into the directory containing this repository as above
cd nhshackday.github.io.git

# Build docker image
docker build -t nhshd-gh-pages .

# Run Jekyll in the docker image (on unix)
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -v `pwd`:/src/nhshackday.github.io nhshd-gh-pages

# Run Jekyll in the docker image (on Windows in cmd.exe)
docker run --rm -it -p 4000:4000 -v %CD%:/src/nhshackday.github.io nhshd-gh-pages

# Explained: Run interactively and automatically remove the container when it exits
docker run --rm -it
    # Map port 4004 on the host to 4000 on the container
    -p 4004:4000
    # Map the fully specified path <nhshd-dir> to /src/nhshackday.github.io in the image
    -v `pwd`:/src/nhshackday.github.io
    # Run the `nhshd-gh-pages` iamge
    nhshd-gh-pages
```

### GitHub Actions (automatic staging of Pull Requests)

_Note: automatic deployment only works if you have write permissions on the `nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io` repository and create Pull Requests from branches on the repository. This is due to the way [security restrictions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/encrypted-secrets#using-encrypted-secrets-in-a-workflow) on GitHub Actions works._

To aid the usability of the Jekyll site and replacing the broken original [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/) implementation [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) are used to create and deploy automatic staging builds to [surge.sh](http://surge.sh). The [original](https://github.com/nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io/blob/ac32954ddf637b90d50fe636d711ec5691ba1904/README.md#travis-ci-automatic-staging-of-pull-requests) Travis CI implementation was  inspired by and adapted from [these](https://zonca.github.io/2013/09/automatically-build-pelican-and-publish-to-github-pages.html) [blogs](https://medium.com/onfido-tech/travis-surge-github-auto-deploy-every-pr-branch-and-tag-a6c8c790831f).

The magic happens in `.github\workflows\staging-build.yml` for this to work the following `Environment Variables` need to be created for the repository under [`Settings > Secrets > Actions`](https://github.com/nhshackday/nhshackday.github.io/settings/secrets/actions):
- `SURGE_LOGIN` set this to the email address of the [surge.sh](http://surge.sh) account to be used.
- `SURGE_TOKEN` set this to the token issued by `surge token` for the account set in `SURGE_LOGIN`.

### Testing on `newNHSHackdaySite.github.io`

**This is has been superseded by the automatic deployment of Pull Requests to [surge.sh](http://surge.sh) using
[GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) see [above](#github-actions-automatic-staging-of-pull-requests)**

```bash
cd WHEREVER_ON_OUR_LOCAL_MACHINE
git checkout -b TEMP_BRANCH_NAME_TO_HOLD_THIS_PR master
git pull https://github.com/YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME/nhshackday.github.io.git BRANCH_NAME_IN_THE_PR
git remote add staging git@github.com:newNHSHackdaySite/newNHSHackdaySite.github.io
git checkout -b NEW_BRANCH_NAME_TO_PUSH_TO_STAGING_SITE
rm CNAME
git commit -a -m "Kill CNAME for staging"
git push staging YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME-NEW_BRANCH_NAME_TO_PUSH_TO_STAGING_SITE:master -f
```
