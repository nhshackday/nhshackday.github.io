## Wish List

Things we'd love to have!

 * HES data -- as a minimum, aggregates could be made available at useful levels : http://www.hscic.gov.uk/hes
 * NICOR -- positive intent, but difficult to find data : http://www.ucl.ac.uk/nicor/nicor/nicorandtheclinicaldatatransparencyinitiative
 * Legacy Library -- to be scraped and mined : http://legacy.library.ucsf.edu/action/search/basic
 * www.scotcourts.gov.uk/opinions/2010FAI15.html -- to be scraped and mined : http://wiki.nhshackday.com/wiki/DatasetsAndAPIs?action=AttachFile&do=view&target=FAIs.zip
 * Data at hospital level rather than trust level -- important for a public audience who don't know or care about who runs an organisation and important for understanding variations within a provider : (no link)
 * CQC's Quality and Risk Profiles (currently only available to providers and CQC staff)
